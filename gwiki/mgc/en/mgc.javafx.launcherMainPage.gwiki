h1. Introduction
Deployment and configuration for a web based java project is often a little complex.
 The launcher Framework tries to simplify deployment of an web application as single jar (optional also .exe) and provides configuration dialogs for standard settings, like Datasources, logging, etc.
 The framework allows to create own dialogs to manage system settings for their web application.
